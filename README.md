# basic-3d-environment
A simple C++ and OpenGL application to test Blender 3d models in (the project binaries are built for Windows x86)

Controls:
Use W and S to move forward and backward
Use A and D to move left and right
Use up arrow key and down arrow key to move up and down
Use mouse to move camera (it's a bit buggy)
The application hides the mouse cursor so to quit you can use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Q
