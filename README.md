# basic-3d-environment
A simple C++ and OpenGL application to test Blender 3d models in (the project binaries are built for Windows x86)

Controls:

* Use W and S to move forward and backward

* Use A and D to move left and right

* Use up arrow key and down arrow key to move up and down

* Use the mouse to move camera (it's a bit buggy)

* The application hides the mouse cursor so to quit you can use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+Q

You should run the exe file in the root folder because it needs access to the GLSL shader files. FYI you will get warnings from Windows that this might be unsafe to run on your computer. It doesn't have any malware in it; Windows is just giving false positives to keep your hardware safe.
